# Ultimate learning repo ðŸ’»</>
Basically a placeholder for my notes on compsci topics that interest me and I want to pursue with resources to tutorials, courses, lectures etc to keep track on them:)
* Each topic folder contains a Resources markdown file with all useful links on covered topics 
* All images are created by me in Figma (imgs folder)
* Random snippets of polish occur :p
##
### Todo
- [x] link names and division for topics in resources
- [ ] KMP algo
- [ ] upload files from previous years
