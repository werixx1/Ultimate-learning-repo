Basically a placeholder for my notes on compsci topics that interest me and I want to pursue with resources to tutorials, courses, lectures etc to keep track on them:)

* Each topic folder contains a Resources markdown file with all useful links on covered topics 
* All images are created by me in Figma (imgs folder)
##
### Todo
- [ ] link names and division for topics in resources
- [ ] KMP algo
- [ ] upload files from previous years
